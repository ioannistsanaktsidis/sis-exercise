      "abstract": "We show that the large \r\nN\r\nN limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \r\nN\r\nN. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \r\nN\r\n=\r\n4\r\nN=4 super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.",

      "title": "The Beauty of Flavour Physics: B Meson Decays: Do They Reveal New Physics?",
      "abstract": "This thesis discusses benchmark decays of $B$ mesons, which are excellent tools for testing the theory of the Standard Model of particle physics and exploring New Physics effects. A central part of our analysis is the exploration of the violation of the CP symmetry, where C stands for charge conjugation and P for parity (i.e., space inversion). Since CP violation has different manifestations, we explore the topic by categorizing the decays according to their dynamics and study each category separately. The first category refers to decays dominated by tree topologies, although penguin (loop) topologies also play a role. Key examples include the $B^0_d \\to J/\\psi K^0_S$ and $B^0_s \\to J/\\psi \\phi$ modes. These decays are central for exploring parameters associated with the phenomenon of $B^0_q$-$\\bar{B}^0_q$ mixing. We have suggested methods for properly including the penguin contributions in the analysis of these mixing parameters. There are also decays which are pure tree transitions, such as the $B_s \\to D_s^{\\pm} K^{\\mp}$ system and the related modes. These decays allow theoretically clean determinations of the angle $\\gamma$ of the Unitarity Triangle. Utilising experimental data, we have revealed puzzling patterns in these decays which could be footprints of New Physics. We have presented a model-independent analysis to account for such New Physics effects. Another category includes decays dominated by penguins, such as the $B \\to \\pi K$ channels. We have addressed the long-standing puzzling patterns in the data within this system, discussing correlations between key observables. We have proposed strategies for further exploring these intriguing cases and optimally determining the parameters describing the puzzling effects. These strategies can be applied in the future high-precision experiments in $B$ physics. Last but not least, there are decays arising from electroweak penguins and box topologies, such as the leptonic $B^{0}_{(s)} \\to \\mu^{+} \\mu^{-}$ modes, which also have a rich phenomenology related to CP violation. These are very rare processes in the Standard Model. In our analysis, we have utilised these interesting modes as a probe for New Physics. Throughout this thesis, we have discussed exciting new perspectives to further explore CP violation. Comparing our theoretical predictions with experimental measurements allows us to test the Standard Model quark sector and search for physics beyond the Standard Model, highlighting the importance of synergies between theorists and experimentalists. Thrilling times lie ahead of us as we move into the era of the highest precision in $B$ physics. Utilising our theoretical analyses and methods we may eventually identify New Physics and reveal new sources of CP violation, opening up new horizons in the field of particle physics.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables <math altimg=\"si1.svg\"><mi>X</mi><mo>,</mo><mspace width=\"0.2em\"/><mi>T</mi></math>, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space X and time T, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space X are identified with certain members of the Painlevé-III hierarchy. We study the large X and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large T. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.",

      "abstract": "We present a quantum-classical algorithm called LAS-QKSD for multireference systems, by combining a classical localized active space (LAS) fragment-based multireference algorithm with the quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) method for quantum computers. The algorithm uses wave-function information from a LAS self-consistent field (LASSCF) calculation to prepare an initial state with better overlap with the target ground state than the Hartree-Fock state. This is coupled with the use of QKSD to ultimately converge to the exact energy, providing faster convergence than starting from the Hartree-Fock state. Fragmentation has the twofold benefit of fewer configurations on the classical side of the algorithm as well as fewer state preparation gates on the quantum side. First, we compare the LAS-QKSD method to the classical LASSCF method and to QKSD with a Hartree-Fock initial state. We then examine ways to load the LASSCF wave function using direct initialization and a QKSD-motivated spectral filtering approach. Finally, using a bimetallic complex, we show that the LAS-QKSD method is an efficient alternative to highly expensive complete active space self-consistent field calculations on strongly correlated systems.",

      "abstract": "Pulsar timing arrays seek and study gravitational waves (GWs) through the angular two-point correlation function of timing residuals they induce in pulsars. The two-point correlation function induced by the standard transverse-traceless GWs is the famous Hellings-Downs curve, a function only of the angle between the two pulsars. Additional polarization modes (vector or scalar) that may arise in alternative-gravity theories have different angular correlation functions. Furthermore, anisotropy, linear, or circular polarization in the stochastic GW background gives rise to additional structure in the two-point correlation function that cannot be written simply in terms of the angular separation of the two pulsars. In this Letter, we provide a simple formula for the most general two-point correlation function—or overlap reduction function (ORF)—for a gravitational-wave background with an arbitrary polarization state, possibly containing anisotropies in its intensity and polarization (linear and/or circular). We provide specific expressions for the ORFs sourced by the general-relativistic transverse-traceless GW modes as well as vector (or spin-1) modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories.",

Designed for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level physics students, the text only requires previous courses in classical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.The introductory chapters of the book summarise the theory of special relativity and its application to the classical description of the motion of a free particle and a field. The authors then explain the quantum formulation of field theory through the simple example of a scalar field described by the Klein–Gordon equation as well as its extension to the case of spin ½ particles described by the Dirac equation. They also present the elements necessary for constructing the foundational theories of the standard model of electroweak interactions, namely quantum electrodynamics and the Fermi theory of neutron beta decay. Many applications to quantum electrodynamics and weak interaction processes are thoroughly analysed. The book also explores the timely topic of neutrino oscillations.Logically progressing from the fundamentals to recent discoveries, this textbook provides students with the essential foundation to study more advanced theoretical physics and elementary particle physics. It will help them understand the theory of electroweak interactions and gauge theories.View the second and third books in this collection: Electroweak Interactions and An Introduction to Gauge Theories.Key Features of the new edition:Besides a general revision of text and formulae, three new chapters have been added.·         Chapter 17 introduces and discusses double beta decay processes with and without neutrino emission, the latter being the only process able to determine the Dirac or Majorana nature of the neutrino (discussed in Chapter 13). A discussion of the limits to the Majorana neutrino mass obtained recently in several underground laboratories is included.·         Chapter 18 illustrates the calculation of the mass spectrum of “quarkonia” (mesons composed by a pair of heavy, charm or beauty quarks), in analogy with the positronium spectrum discussed in Chapter 12. This calculation has put into evidence the existence of “unexpected” states and has led to the new field of “exotic hadrons”, presently under active theoretical and experimental scrutiny.·         Chapter 19 illustrates the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, extensively used in the computation of simple molecules, and its application to the physics of exotic hadrons containing a pair of heavy quarks, with application to the recently observed doubly charmed baryons.This eBook was published Open Access with funding support from the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP3).A PDF version of this book is available for free in Open Access at www.taylorfrancis.com.
